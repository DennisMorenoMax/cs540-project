# cs540-project
Database and Data Retrieval to compute the computational statistics analysis of the sales analysis dataset from the volusia county at Daytona Beach, FL

The final attributes that I will be using to compute the computational statistics on QGIS will be: aprland, aprbldg, aprtot, rmbed, sfla, sale_date, water_front, vegetation_front, crime, health zones, airport, parcels that has pool, census tracts, where the sale_date was split it up in day, month, and year.

The abbreviations of some attributes used:

Aprland: Total Land Just Value

Aprbldg: Total Building(s) Just Value

Aprtot: Total Just Value

Rmbed: Number of Bedrooms

Sfla: Square Footage of Living Area

# In order to convert shapefile into data on PGadmin I used the following:
The get_load_gis.bat file to run and convert the shapefile into data. The respective procedure on how to do it is explained on the how_to_load_shapefiles_to_pgadmin_as_numerical_data.txt file.
