# cs540-project
Database and Data Retrieval for an computational statistics analysis of a price prediction of parcels from the volusia county at Daytona Beach, FL

The final attributes that I will be using to compute the computational statistics on QGIS will be: aprland, aprbldg, aprtot, rmbed, sfla, sale_date, water_front, vegetation_front, crime, health zones, airport, parcels that has pool, census tracts, where the sale_date was split it up in day, month, and year.
Aprland: Total Land Just Value
Aprbldg: Total Building(s) Just Value
Aprtot: Total Just Value
Rmbed: Number of Bedrooms
Sfla: Square Footage of Living Area
